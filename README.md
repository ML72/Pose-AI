# Template Code

This is boilerplate code for a cross-platform mobile application using the following frameworks:
- **React** for user interface
- **Capacitor** for cross-platform
- **Material UI** for styling

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies in the project directory:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the following to start the development server:

    ```

3. Open a browser and go to `localhost:5173` to see the app!

4. Type `Ctrl+C` or `q` in the terminal with the server to stop the server.
